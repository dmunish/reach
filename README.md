# REACH
### Real-time Emergency Alert Collection Hub
AI-powered disaster alert system for Pakistan that automatically processes official emergency warnings and delivers location-targeted alerts to communities in real-time.
##Problem
Pakistan's disaster warning system suffers from critical gaps:

Fragmented alerts across multiple agencies (NDMA, PDMAs, PMD)
Generic province-wide warnings instead of location-specific guidance
Technical reports that communities can't understand or act upon
2-6 hour delays between official warnings and community awareness

## Solution
REACH bridges the gap between institutional forecasting and community preparedness through:

**Automated Processing**: AI extracts actionable information from official PDFs, maps, and reports
**Location Targeting**: Precise alerts based on GPS coordinates and administrative boundaries
**Real-time Delivery**: Mobile/web apps with push notifications and SMS integration
**Community Integration**: Platform for verified field officers to submit ground-level reports
