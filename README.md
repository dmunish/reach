# REACH
### **Real-time Emergency Alert Collection Hub**

<div><img src="Assets\REACH-Banner.png"></div>

Pakistan's disaster alerts are trapped in PDFs, buried in social media, and fragmented across agencies. Meanwhile, millions wait for warnings that arrive too late—or never reach them at all. REACH uses AI to transform this chaos into clarity, automatically collecting and processing emergency alerts into location-specific warnings that actually save lives.

## 🚨 The Problem

The 2025 Pakistan floods impacted **6.9 million people** and resulted in **1,037 fatalities**. Despite having early warning systems, communities continue to face devastating losses because:

- 📄 **Critical alerts are buried in verbose PDFs** that take hours to parse
- 🗺️ **Warnings lack location specificity** - entire provinces get alerted when only specific districts are at risk  
- ⏱️ **Information travels too slowly** through bureaucratic hierarchies
- 🔍 **No unified view** of threats across NDMA, PDMAs, PMD, and other sources
- 📱 **Digital infrastructure is underutilized** despite 79% mobile penetration

**The gap between institutional forecasting and community-level preparedness is costing lives.**

## 💡 Our Solution

REACH bridges this gap with **AI-powered alert intelligence**. Our system:

🔄 **Automatically scrapes** official sources (NDMA, NEOC, PMD, PDMAs)  
🧠 **Transforms chaos into clarity** using Vision-Language Models and LLMs  
🗺️ **Maps threats precisely** with intelligent geocoding  
📲 **Delivers actionable alerts** through a real-time dashboard

### What Makes REACH Different

**Multimodal AI Processing** 🎯  
Unlike text-only systems, REACH uses Vision-Language Models to extract critical information from weather maps, infographics, and scanned bulletins that human operators would need hours to interpret.

**Intelligent Normalization** 📝  
Advanced LLM reasoning transforms verbose reports like *"moderate to heavy rainfall expected in upper catchments"* into clear guidance: *"Flash flood risk in Swat River areas - evacuate low-lying areas immediately."*

**CAP-Standard Structuring** 📊  
All alerts are normalized to Common Alerting Protocol-inspired JSON format, making them machine-readable and integration-ready for future notification systems.

## ✨ Current Prototype Features

Our hackathon submission demonstrates the core intelligence layer:

### 🔍 Smart Document Scraping
- Monitors NDMA situation reports, NEOC updates, and PMD bulletins
- Handles PDFs, HTML pages, and social media posts
- Resilient parsing that adapts to format changes

### 🤖 AI-Powered Processing
- **Vision-Language Models** extract data from weather maps and infographics
- **Reasoning LLMs** understand context and severity
- **Geocoding engine** translates vague locations ("areas downstream of Tarbela Dam") into precise coordinates

### 🗺️ Real-Time Dashboard
- Interactive map visualization of active threats
- Filterable by region, severity, and alert type
- Historical alert database for pattern analysis

### 📋 Structured Data Output
```json
{
  "identifier": "NDMA-2025-FLOOD-001",
  "severity": "Extreme",
  "event": "Flash Flood",
  "headline": "Immediate evacuation required for Swat River areas",
  "areas": [
    {
      "name": "Swat District",
      "geocode": [35.2227, 72.4258]
    }
  ],
  "instruction": "Evacuate low-lying areas immediately. Move to higher ground.",
  "expires": "2025-01-04T18:00:00+05:00"
}
```

## 📊 Impact Potential

### Immediate Impact
- ⚡ **10-minute alert delivery** vs current 2-6 hour delays
- 🎯 **District-level precision** vs province-wide warnings
- 📖 **Plain-language guidance** vs technical jargon
- 🌐 **Single unified view** of all official sources

### Long-term Vision
According to UN research, comprehensive multi-hazard early warning systems reduce disaster-related fatality rates by **82.5%** (from 4.05 to 0.71 per 100,000 population). REACH's intelligence layer is the critical foundation for achieving this in Pakistan.
